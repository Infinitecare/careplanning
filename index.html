      <h2>Care Plan</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A Nursing Care Plan in aged care is a structured, individualized
          document that outlines a resident's healthcare needs, goals, and the
          interventions required to achieve those goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is developed collaboratively by nurses, allied health
          professionals, and sometimes the resident and their family, ensuring a
          person-centered approach to care.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <h3>My Goals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I want to prevent pressure injuries by having regular
              repositioning, using pressure-relieving devices, and having my
              skin checked often.
            </li>
            <li>
              I want to stay well-hydrated and have a nutritious diet to keep my
              skin healthy and strong.

          <h3>My Observations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Observe and document the resident’s repositioning schedule,
              ensuring they are turned or repositioned at appropriate intervals
              (e.g., every 2 hours for bed-bound residents).
            </li>
            <li>
              Assess and record skin integrity during routine checks, noting any
              signs of redness, pressure areas, or skin breakdown, and escalate
              concerns as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Monitor and document the resident’s daily fluid intake, ensuring
              they meet the recommended hydration levels (e.g., 1.5–2 liters per
              day, unless contraindicated).
            </li>
            <li>
              Observe for signs of dehydration or malnutrition, such as dry
              skin, poor skin turgor, reduced appetite, or unintended weight
              loss, and report any concerns to the healthcare team.

          <h3>Interventions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Assist the resident with regular repositioning (e.g., every 2
              hours in bed, every 1 hour in a chair) and document each change to
              prevent prolonged pressure on any one area.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide and maintain pressure-relieving equipment such as
              alternating air mattresses, pressure cushions, and heel protectors
              to reduce the risk of skin breakdown.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct daily skin assessments, focusing on pressure-prone areas
              (e.g., sacrum, heels, elbows), and report any redness, breakdown,
              or signs of infection to the healthcare team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regularly check for signs such as dry skin, poor skin turgor,
              cracked lips, and unintended weight loss, and escalate concerns to
              the healthcare team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offer high-protein or fortified drinks as prescribed to support
              skin health and overall well-being, particularly for residents
              with reduced appetite.

      <h3>Lets check your Understanding of Nursing CarePlan</h3>
      <h4>Clinical Scenario</h4>
      <p>
        ### **Scenario: Resident Explaining Goals to the Nurse** **Resident:**
        *"Nurse, I want to talk about my care plan. There are two things that
        are really important to me."* **Nurse:** *"Of course! I’m here to
        listen. What would you like to discuss?"* **Resident:** *"First, I want
        to make sure I don’t get any pressure injuries. I know staying in bed
        for too long can cause sores, so I want to be repositioned regularly.
        Also, I’ve heard that using special cushions or mattresses can help. Can
        you make sure my skin is checked often to catch any early signs of
        problems?"* **Nurse:** *"That’s a great goal! I’ll ensure we follow a
        regular repositioning schedule and use pressure-relieving equipment to
        keep you comfortable. I’ll also check your skin daily and report any
        concerns immediately."* **Resident:** *"Thank you! The other thing I’m
        worried about is staying hydrated and eating well. I don’t always feel
        thirsty, but I know my skin stays healthier when I drink enough water.
        And I want to make sure I’m getting the right foods to keep my skin
        strong."* **Nurse:** *"I understand. I’ll remind you to drink water
        throughout the day and track your fluid intake. I’ll also work with the
        dietitian to make sure your meals are packed with the right nutrients to
        support your skin health. If needed, we can add some supplements too."*
        **Resident:** *"That sounds good! I just want to stay as healthy as
        possible and avoid any unnecessary problems."* **Nurse:** *"Absolutely,
        and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way!"*
